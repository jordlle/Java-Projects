# Java Projects Over The Years

## [Project 1: Recursion](https://github.com/jordlle/Java-Projects/blob/main/Recursion.java)
- This program prompts the user to input information and perform various actions based on their decision with the given menu.
- This class will use recursive methods to perform different calculations for each menu option.

## Project 2: Aggregation
### [Driver Class](https://github.com/jordlle/Java-Projects/blob/main/Driver.java)
- The driver class displays a menu of choices to a user and performs the chosen task.
- It will keep asking a user to enter the next choice until the choice of 'Q' (Quit) is entered.

### [Student Class](https://github.com/jordlle/Java-Projects/blob/main/Student.java)
- The Student class will get the ID, major, and course corresponding to a student (who represents a new object), and return their information as a string, along with the course information from the Course class.

### [Course Class](https://github.com/jordlle/Java-Projects/blob/main/Course.java)
- The Course class describes information for a course, including course ID, the instructor, and the subject. Returning course
information as in the classes' toString method.

## Project 3: Queue
### [Driver Class](https://github.com/jordlle/Java-Projects/blob/main/Queue.java)
